# Figma MCP Configuration Guide

## Setting up Figma MCP in Cursor

Figma MCP allows you to interact with Figma designs directly from Cursor. Here's how to set it up:

### Option 1: Using Cursor Settings UI

1. Open Cursor Settings (`Cmd/Ctrl + ,`)
2. Navigate to **Features** → **MCP Servers**
3. Click **Add Server** or **+**
4. Configure with these settings:

```json
{
  "name": "figma",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "-y",
    "@modelcontextprotocol/server-figma"
  ],
  "env": {
    "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-figma-access-token-here"
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Manual Configuration File

If Cursor supports a config file, you can add this to your Cursor settings:

**Location**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json` or in Cursor's settings directory

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-figma"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-figma-access-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Getting Your Figma Access Token

1. Go to https://www.figma.com/
2. Sign in to your account
3. Go to **Settings** → **Account** → **Personal Access Tokens**
4. Click **Create new token**
5. Give it a name (e.g., "Cursor MCP")
6. Copy the token and use it in the configuration above

### Alternative: Figma API Integration

If you want to use Figma API directly in your Next.js app (not MCP), you can:

1. Install the Figma API package:
```bash
npm install figma-api
```

2. Create an API route in your app to interact with Figma

### Notes

- MCP is configured at the IDE level (Cursor), not in your app code
- The MCP server runs as a separate process that Cursor communicates with
- You'll need a Figma access token to authenticate
- Once configured, you can use commands like "Get design context from Figma" in Cursor
